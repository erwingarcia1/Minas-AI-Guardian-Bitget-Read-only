# Changelog

All notable changes to Minas AI Guardian are documented here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the
project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The internal package/CLI codename is `sentinel`; the product is **Minas AI
Guardian**.

## [Unreleased]

_Pending customer/ops items (not code): read-only Bybit key (previous had
Contract-Trade scope), OKX + Binance keys, Gmail SMTP credentials, ClickSend
or Twilio credentials, terminate the retired us-east-1 instance._

### Added
- **Member SMS alerts (ClickSend) made auditable and member-aware.** Texts to
  a member's phone now carry the product name, severity, alert type, affected
  account, and a member-portal login link (`SENTINEL_PORTAL_URL`) that
  truncation can never cut — only the free-text detail shrinks. Every outcome
  lands in a new `sms_deliveries` audit table linked to the stored alert id:
  the ClickSend message id on success, the provider error on failure, and
  explicit skip/suppress reasons otherwise. Duplicate texts for the same rule
  + account are suppressed within `alerting.sms_cooldown_minutes` (default 30,
  hot-reloaded) — wider than the dispatch dedup key on purpose, so a burst of
  distinct withdrawals pages the member once with full detail on
  Telegram/email. A new `sms_alerts_enabled` member preference is respected,
  with CRITICAL overriding an opt-out per
  `alerting.sms_critical_overrides_optout` (business rule, default true). A
  CRITICAL alert with no phone on file is logged and recorded instead of
  silently dropped, and the dashboard's security-posture panel now nudges the
  operator to add or verify a number. `sentinel set-contact` gains
  `--sms-alerts on|off`.
- **Member portal** (new server on `:8391`): customers sign in with their
  email + an operator-generated password and see **only their own** accounts,
  alerts, events, and security posture. Cross-member isolation is the hard
  invariant — every query is scoped to the signed-in member's account ids, and
  a drill-down on an unowned/nonexistent id returns 404 without disclosing it.
  Passwords are scrypt-hashed with a constant-time email lookup (no
  member-existence timing oracle); sessions are HMAC-signed `HttpOnly`/`Secure`/
  `SameSite=Lax` cookies (12 h); login is throttled per-email and per-IP. No
  self-registration — the operator issues each password (shown once) from a new
  **Member portal access** card on the ops account drill-down. The portal is a
  separate read-only HTTP server sharing nothing with the network-gated ops
  view. Reviewed by an adversarial security panel (isolation / auth-session /
  web-surface / correctness); the one confirmed finding (a login timing oracle)
  is fixed and regression-tested.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard outage (2026-07-06)**: `latest_balance_snapshot` used a
  correlated `MAX(snapshot_at)` subquery — quadratic cost on a table growing
  every fast loop. ~10h after deploy the engine held the SQLite lock nearly
  continuously and dashboard renders stalled past browser timeouts (polling
  and alerting stayed healthy). Query de-correlated, `(account_id,
  snapshot_at)` index added, and snapshots now prune to a 7-day window on the
  slow loop.
- **Bybit onboarding gate rejected every real read-only key**: Bybit's
  `permissions` entries are scopes (what the key may *read*), listed even on
  `readOnly: 1` keys, and reading balances/orders requires them. The
  defense-in-depth scan treated them as write grants, so no functional
  read-only key could pass. `readOnly == 1` remains the enforced bar; only a
  `Withdraw` scope still fails closed. Tests now mock the populated-scopes
  shape Bybit actually returns.
- **Binance false CRITICAL quantity-drop alerts**: closed-order coverage now
  includes quote coins as bases (BTC sells), pairs from the traded-pair
  baseline, and coins held on the previous poll (sold-to-zero assets), with
  held-coin symbols surviving the per-cycle budget ahead of stale hints.
- **Binance transfer blindness**: `fetch_transfers` now sweeps both directions
  of spot⇄funding/futures/margin instead of ccxt's spot→USD-M-futures default,
  cached per poll cycle.
- **First-poll false HIGH `transfer_route_never_seen` alerts**: onboarding now
  seeds pre-existing transfer routes/history (top-10 coins) into the baseline,
  the same way withdrawals and traded pairs were already seeded.
- **OKX IP-allowlist drift detection was inert**: OKX reports the allowlist as
  `ip` (singular); now normalized to the `ips` field the drift detector reads.
- **Off-market detection silently skipped on mixed batches**: a rejected batch
  ticker call (Bybit spot+derivatives) now falls back to per-symbol fetches.
- **Rate-limit accounting**: multi-call pulls (Bybit/OKX category loops,
  Binance per-symbol/per-route loops) now charge the shared egress-IP budget
  per real HTTP call via an `acquire` hook, instead of a flat 4 per loop.
- **Binance gate hardening**: unrecognized *enabled* permission flags now fail
  closed (Binance keeps adding trade-capable flags); CLI onboarding no longer
  prompts for a passphrase Binance doesn't have.
- **ccxt pinned to 4.5.63** — the version every adapter behavior was verified
  against; image rebuilds no longer float to untested releases.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-05

First production release. Running on AWS Tokyo (ap-northeast-1), reachable
over a Tailscale-served HTTPS dashboard.

### Added
- **Account drill-down** (`/account?id=N`): per-customer detail page with the
  customer profile (name, license, primary + secondary email/phone, Telegram
  handles), account config, a plain-language **security-posture** panel (what
  keeps the account safe), the full detection catalog, and that account's own
  event + alert history. API secrets are never rendered.
- **Add-customer web form** (`/add`) behind the fail-closed read-only gate:
  a submitted trade/withdraw key is rejected and nothing is stored; the
  rejection reason is shown inline. Cross-origin POSTs blocked; secrets never
  echoed back.
- **ClickSend SMS** provider (verified against ClickSend's API) with a
  provider factory that prefers ClickSend when configured and falls back to
  Twilio — for both the global SMS channel and per-customer delivery.
- **Per-customer alert delivery** to primary + secondary email/phone, in
  addition to global severity routing. Telegram handles are stored (Bot API
  can't DM an arbitrary handle without opt-in).
- **VA/team Telegram group** channel (`telegram_team`): routes CRITICAL/HIGH
  to a shared group in addition to the personal chat.
- `sentinel set-contact` CLI to set/clear an existing account's alert contact.
- Customer schema: `customer_name`, secondary email/phone, two Telegram
  handles, `license` (with online migrations for the deployed database).

### Changed
- Metrics page nav links are same-origin (`/`, `/metrics/raw`) so they work
  behind the Tailscale HTTPS proxy; added a `/metrics/raw` route serving the
  raw Prometheus exposition on the dashboard port.
- Dashboard/metrics served over one port so a single tunnel reaches both.

### Fixed
- `sentinel_accounts_active` gauge was defined but never updated (stuck at 0);
  the engine now sets it each schedule cycle.

### Infrastructure
- Migrated production from AWS us-east-1 to **ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo)** — the
  US region geo-blocks Bybit, Binance Global, and OKX Global; Tokyo reaches
  all four. Database migrated with baseline + history intact.
- Dashboard exposed via **Tailscale Serve** (HTTPS, tailnet-only) — no public
  ports, no SSH tunnel; VAs are added by tailnet invite.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-05

### Added
- **OKX Global** support: `perm`-field read-only gate (accept only
  `read_only`), passphrase required, instType-iterating order coverage.
- **Binance Global** support: `apiRestrictions` read-only gate (all nine
  write-implying flags must be false; a missing flag fails closed), no
  passphrase, balance-derived per-symbol order coverage.
- All four exchanges (Bitget, Bybit, OKX, Binance) selectable at onboarding.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-05

### Added
- **Multi-exchange architecture**: `ExchangeClient` base + per-exchange
  clients + `make_client` factory; per-exchange read-only dispatch.
- **Bybit** support with a fail-closed `readOnly`-flag gate plus a
  defense-in-depth write-permission denylist. The gate passed a 0-finding
  adversarial review.
- `exchange` / per-account alert-contact columns; passphrase made optional
  (Bybit/Binance have none).

### Changed
- Styled metrics view served at the dashboard's `/metrics` so a single tunnel
  reaches both pages (raw Prometheus stays on :9109 for scrapers).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-05

### Added
- Docker deployment hardening: container `cap_drop: [ALL]`,
  `no-new-privileges`, pid/memory limits, healthcheck, log rotation;
  `.dockerignore`; EC2 `user-data` bootstrap script.
- AWS-first deployment guide with SSH-tunnel dashboard access and a rehearsed
  DB-migration procedure.

### Fixed
- Packaged `schema.sql` (clean installs crash-looped without it).
- Pinned the container DB path so a host `.env` can't redirect the credentials
  DB into the disposable container filesystem.
- Findings from an adversarial deployment-asset review (permissions, sudo,
  `python`→`python3`, false "hot-reload" claims).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-02

Initial MVP (Phases 0–3, Bitget only).

### Added
- Phase 0 capability audit verified against live CCXT source and Bitget docs
  (signal-availability matrix, proxy designs, rate-limit math).
- Fail-closed read-only key onboarding with encrypted credential storage.
- 12-rule detection catalog with trigger/non-trigger tests per rule.
- Scheduler → queue → worker pool; per-UID + egress-IP token buckets;
  per-account circuit breakers (100-account soak).
- ccxt.pro WebSocket monitor with reconnect + dead-stream watchdog.
- Alerting: Telegram / Twilio SMS / SMTP email with severity routing, dedup +
  cooldown, unacked-CRITICAL escalation, daily digest; optional AI triage.
- Branded status dashboard + Prometheus metrics; Docker Compose; docs (threat
  model, customer runbook, deployment, data retention).
